### Atom Add Ons
Atom is great because of the flexibility to add any package you like.  Here are my add-ons that I use:
#### Important
*  *[Hydrogen](https://atom.io/packages/Hydrogen)* - Run code interactively, inspect data, and plot. All the power of Jupyter kernels, inside your favorite text editor.  
* *[linter-flake8](https://atom.io/packages/linter-flake8)* - Atom linter plugin for Python, using flake8. **I suggest every one to use this! It provides helpful reminders to design proper code.**
* *[scripts](https://atom.io/packages/script)* - Run scripts based on file name, a selection of code, or by line number.  
* *[markdown-preview-plus](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-plus)* - Markdown Preview + Community Features
* *[minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap)* - A preview of the full source code.
#### Nice to have
* *[multi-cursor-plus](https://atom.io/packages/multi-cursor-plus)* - Improved multi-cursor functionality for Atom
* *[vim-mode-plus](https://atom.io/packages/vim-mode-plus)* - I enjoy coding in vim so this emulator does wonders for me
* *[autocomplete-python](https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-python)* - Python completions for packages, variables, methods, functions, with their arguments. Powered by your choice of Jedi or Kite.
*  *[busy-signal](https://atom.io/packages/busy-signal)* - A package that provides an easy to use API to show your package is performing a task
* *[highlight-selected](https://atom.io/packages/highlight-selected)* - Highlights the current word selected when double clicking
* *[pigments](https://atom.io/packages/pigments)* - A package to display colors in project and files.
